# DISCLAIMER
# This is an example of input for EC Pollard Rho
# You may assume that the input is correct:
# -- a, b do define an elliptic curve over GF(p)
# -- P is a point on the curve
# -- n is the order of P (the size of <P>)
# -- Q is a multiple of P
# You may also assume that I will test your code with the same order of parameters, and with the same disclaimer
