# DISCLAIMER
# Example of output for Basic Pollard Rho
# You needn't write the disclaimer but please write the inputs so it's easier for me to check your results
# IMPORTANT: 
# 1. You may not necessarily get the same collision than I did for this example. 
# 2. A "collision" where c=c' and d=d' is not valid.
